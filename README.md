## Overview
During my time working on the Lumios Studio project, I had the chance to level up my React skills and dive into the world of animations using the "Framer Motion" library.

Mastering Animations: The most exciting part was using the "Framer Motion" library to make things move and react in cool ways. I learned how to make smooth transitions, eye-catching effects, and engaging animations that made the app more fun to use.
